# Evaluate the performance of the peptigate workflow on the human transcriptome

The [notebook](./20240319-human-txome-results.ipynb) in this directory provides an overview of the results of the peptigate run on the human transcriptome.
It primarily examines the number of peptigate-predicted peptides that had matches in the Peptipedia database, thereby providing evidence that the peptide is real. [Peptipedia](https://app.peptipedia.cl/) is a metadatabase with peptide sequences from 76 databases encompassing 213 bioactivities.
